# Overview

Now that we know how to get a triangle on screen, we'll dive into the more simple topics in rendering.

We'll talk about the rasterizer state and what it can do for us, get some textures onto our geometry, and explain everything we need to get a 3D model properly rendering.

Finally we'll add a tool that almost everyone uses, "Dear ImGui" which allows is to very flexibly add some UI to control things in our scenes.
