# Overview

We are about to introduce models to our little framework we have so far.

Models are an essential piece of every game or graphics engine.

Models also means textures and images, otherwise it gets too boring :)

We will be using AssImp to load models and FreeImage to load images to create textures.

Apart from that we will also be learning what a depth buffer is, why index buffers are helpful,

how coordinate systems work and how we can make use of them.

At the end we will also be able to roam around freely by using a camera.
