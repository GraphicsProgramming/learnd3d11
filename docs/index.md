# Welcome to Learning Direct3D11

## Introduction

Goal of this thing

### DX API Overview

DirectX consists of various components such as

### Libraries & Project Layout

For the LearnD3D11 tutorial series we will be using the following third party libraries

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org) It provides the window to render our things in, as well as input
handling via mouse and keyboard. Yes there are also alternatives like `SDL2` for instance.
It serves the same purpose, we just decided to go with `GLFW`.
You might also wonder about "I want to do it myself, from scratch" then you really
could do it yourself; but its the year 2022 by the time we are writing this thing
and the problem of creating a window and handling input has been solved many times
already, why reinvent the wheel. We have a link [here](DIYWinApi.md) to show how you could do it).

- [DirectXMath](...link...) As it is part of the Windows SDK, this is the math library we will use.

- [Assimp](www.assimp.org) Assimp provides facilities to load mesh files of various file formats.

- [dear IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) dear IMGUI is an easy to use immediate mode
graphics user interface library, its widely used in the industry and we will be using it to
display interactive options

# 0. Initial Setup

!!! question "Initial Project"

    Prepare empty project, readily setup with GLFW-lib and user can
    copy paste single steps, or provide a ready to use project

!!! question ""

    Explain how to install glfw, provide screen shots

Assume we cloned the empty main, already setup with `GLFW`

## HelloWindow

OK let's start with the whole example for a HelloWindow first

```cpp
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    if (!glfwInit())
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to initialize\n";
        return -1;
    }

    GLFWmonitor* primaryMonitor = glfwGetPrimaryMonitor();
    const GLFWvidmode* videoMode = glfwGetVideoMode(primaryMonitor);
    const int32_t width = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->width * 0.9f);
    const int32_t height = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->height * 0.9f);

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR, GLFW_FALSE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    const GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(
        width,
        height,
        "LearnD3D11 - Hello Window",
        nullptr,
        nullptr);
    if (window == nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to create window\n";
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }

    const int32_t windowLeft = videoMode->width / 2 - width / 2;
    const int32_t windowTop = videoMode->height / 2 - height / 2;
    glfwSetWindowPos(window, windowLeft, windowTop);

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
    {
        glfwPollEvents();
        // future update code
        // future render code
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);
    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

Now let me explain what all these things mean.

```cpp
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
```

C++ needs to know where all the definitions and declarations are coming from.

```cpp
    if (!glfwInit())
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to initialize\n";
        return -1;
    }
```

Pretty obvious, right? [glfwInit](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__init.html#ga317aac130a235ab08c6db0834907d85e) tries to initialize `GLFW`. If it fails to do so,
let the user know and end the program, since there is no point in going further.

```cpp
    GLFWmonitor* primaryMonitor = glfwGetPrimaryMonitor();
    const GLFWvidmode* videoMode = glfwGetVideoMode(primaryMonitor);
    const int32_t width = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->width * 0.9f);
    const int32_t height = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->height * 0.9f);
```

This piece of code grabs the main monitor via [glfwGetPrimaryMonitor](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__monitor.html#gac3adb24947eb709e1874028272e5dfc5) and
its current resolution with [glfwGetVideoMode](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__monitor.html#gaba376fa7e76634b4788bddc505d6c9d5),
so that we can derive a window width and height from it - and it will look
similar no matter what resolution you use. Size-wise it will be 90% fullscreen.

```cpp
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR, GLFW_FALSE);
```

This will tell `GLFW` to not scale the window in any way, should you have setup a specific
scaling other than 100% on your desktop. That will keep the windowsize at what we set it,
without thinking about odd fractionals to manually scale the windowsize for any arbitrary scaling on your OS.

```cpp
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
```

`GLFW` was initially meant to support development of OpenGL based applications,
hence the gl in its name, but over the years it also supports other APIs not just OpenGL.
Now since `GLFW` automatically creates a context for OpenGL we can tell it not to do
it via [glfwWindowHint](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#ga7d9c8c62384b1e2821c4dc48952d2033).

```cpp
    const GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(
        width,
        height,
        "LearnD3D11 - Hello Window",
        nullptr,
        nullptr);
    if (window == nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to create window\n";
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }
```

This piece actually creates the window, if everything goes well. We pass in desired window
dimensions and a title, and call [glfwCreateWindow](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#ga3555a418df92ad53f917597fe2f64aeb).
Make sure to check the return value, window creation can fail.

```cpp
    const int32_t windowLeft = videoMode->width / 2 - width / 2;
    const int32_t windowTop = videoMode->height / 2 - height / 2;
    glfwSetWindowPos(window, windowLeft, windowTop);
```

I like centered windows, but `GLFW` will not place the window in a centered fashion,
because of that we try to do it ourselves here with the help of a bit of math and [glfwSetWindowPos](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#ga1abb6d690e8c88e0c8cd1751356dbca8). It sets the window position in screen coordinates, specified by the top left corner of the window.

```cpp
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
    {
        glfwPollEvents();
        // future update code
        // future render code
    }
```

That is more or less the heart of your application, the mainloop.
You could also call it game loop, since in here everything happens.
From reading keyboard and mouse input, reacting to it, to telling the graphics
card to put a frog on the screen. It will keep doing it, until it gets signaled
to not to do that anymore because you closed the window for example ([glfwWindowShouldClose](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#ga24e02fbfefbb81fc45320989f8140ab5)), or hit Escape and mapped Escape to close the window.
[glfwPollEvents](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#ga37bd57223967b4211d60ca1a0bf3c832) will make sure that `GLFW` knows about all required events coming from the operating system.

```cpp
    glfwDestroyWindow(window);
    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
```

Now we clean up the resources we have created, such as the window itself and
the `GLFW` system. Then simply return to the OS, without any error.

[glfwDestroyWindow](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__window.html#gacdf43e51376051d2c091662e9fe3d7b2) will obviously destroy the window and [glfwTerminate](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__init.html#gaaae48c0a18607ea4a4ba951d939f0901) cleans up `GLFW`.

When you start the program, you should see something like this.

## First abstraction

The further we go into this tutorial series the more stuff we will add to the program.
But we don't want to cram everything into `Main.cpp`, your main entry point of the program.
A good practise is to split up things into smaller units, to not lose overview.

Right now we dont have much to show for, just a window, made by a few lines of code,
but we are going to abstract that code into a new class called `Application` which will also be
our main container so to speak, in which all the magic will happen.

I will show the whole code first, and then explain again what means what.

### Application.hpp

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <string_view>

struct GLFWwindow;

class Application
{
public:
    Application(const std::string_view title);
    virtual ~Application();
    void Run();

protected:
    virtual void Cleanup();
    void Close();
    virtual bool Initialize();
    virtual void Render();
    virtual void Update();

private:
    GLFWwindow* _window = nullptr;
    int32_t _width = 0;
    int32_t _height = 0;
    std::string_view _title;
};
```

### Application.cpp

```cpp
#include "Application.hpp"
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

Application::Application(const std::string_view title)
{
    _title = title;
}

Application::~Application()
{
    Cleanup();
}

void Application::Run()
{
    if (!Initialize())
    {
        return;
    }

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(_window))
    {
        glfwPollEvents();
        Update();
        Render();
    }
}

void Application::Cleanup()
{
    if (_window != nullptr)
    {
        glfwDestroyWindow(_window);
        _window = nullptr;
    }
    glfwTerminate();
}

void Application::Close()
{
    glfwSetWindowShouldClose(_window, GLFW_TRUE);
}

bool Application::Initialize()
{
    if (!glfwInit())
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to initialize\n";
        return false;
    }

    const GLFWmonitor* primaryMonitor = glfwGetPrimaryMonitor();
    const GLFWvidmode* videoMode = glfwGetVideoMode(primaryMonitor);
    _width = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->width * 0.9f);
    _height = static_cast<int32_t>(videoMode->height * 0.9f);

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR, GLFW_FALSE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    _window = glfwCreateWindow(_width, _height, _title.data(), nullptr, nullptr);
    if (_window == nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "GLFW: Unable to create window\n";
        return false;
    }

    const int32_t windowLeft = videoMode->width / 2 - _width / 2;
    const int32_t windowTop = videoMode->height / 2 - _height / 2;
    glfwSetWindowPos(_window, windowLeft, windowTop);

    return true;
}

void Application::Render()
{
}

void Application::Update()
{
}
```

### Main.cpp

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    Application application;
    application.Run();
}
```

Let's start with `Main.cpp`. That's all its doing, creating the application and running it.
In the future this can be accompanied by loading a configuration, initializing a logger,
initiating a connection to a possible server server, or other stuff.

```cpp
public:
...
    void Run();
...
```

This is a section of the `Application` class, showing only its publicly available methods. `Run` being
the most important one to the outside world, like `Main`, it's the entry point into this Application.

We still dont want to cram everything into one main or one method, therefore `Run` is split up
again into the following blocks

```cpp
void Application::Run()
{
    if (!Initialize())
    {
        return;
    }

    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(_window))
    {
        glfwPollEvents();
        Update();
        Render();
    }
}
```

You can clearly see what it is doing. `Initialize` as the name suggests will initialize everything
which is required for the app to run, in our case the window itself.

The next block is the aforementioned mainloop or gameloop, which still does what it was doing before,
checking with the OS if events need to be processed and now we also call a `Update` and `Render` method.

`Update` may contain queries about pressed key or mouse buttons, updating variables or other things
which are - for instance - put on display using the `Render` method.

You probably have noticed that

```cpp
    virtual void Cleanup();
    virtual bool Initialize();
    virtual void Render();
    virtual void Update();
```

all the protected method in `Application` are virtual, that's because we will be deriving from `Application`
in the future and only focus on those four methods if required. We now dont have to deal with the mainloop
anymore for the time being.

If you run this example, you will still get the same window, same behaviour, only the code has been
spit up into a more logical piece of work, which will make our life easier as we move on adding more, stuff.
