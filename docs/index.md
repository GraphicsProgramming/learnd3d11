# Welcome to LearnD3D11

## Goal

This is LearnD3D11, a guide aimed at anyone trying to learn Direct3D11, commonly referred to as
DirectX 11. This guide explains the basic usage of Direct3D11 and general graphics programming
topics and techniques, without requiring any previous experience within this field. The guide's
code itself is written in C++, although if one has experience with C++ and can understand how we
use it, it is probably easily transferable to any other language.

## Disclaimer

We are just a bunch of graphics programming enthusiasts doing all this on our own time. This
project is also still a **work in progress**; a lot of content may be missing or faulty.
If you find typos, bugs or have questions, don't hesitate to open an issue or even send a PR.
