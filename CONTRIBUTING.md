Welcome graphics programming frogger.

You decide(d) to contribute to the team effort of providing a cool learnd3d11 tutorial similar to learnopengl
then all you need is the following things installed

- python
- mkdocs
- mkdocs-material

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then you fork the repo, or when you have direct contribution access clone the repo as usual
Open the folder in vscode for example and simply edit away, all in markdown.

to watch what you are doing you can run (and should)

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

that will provide a live version of your edit, running on your local machine.

As soon as you want to commit, provide a meaningful commit message, please.

That's it :)
